{% macro pentextmsubversion() -%}
<p>
    <span class="card" onclick="dC('pentextmsubversion')">Pentex™ Subversion</span>
    has been modified by an <em>errata</em> in September 2019.
    It does not prevent a vampire to act anymore, so it is less powerful and should probably
    not be included in the deck.

{% macro villein() -%}
<p>
    <span class="card" onclick="dC('villein')">Villein</span> has been modified by an errata in June 2018
    to limit the blood taken to a maximum of 5.
    It should still be as efficient as ever in this archetype, though.

{% macro parityshift() -%}
<p>
    <span class="card" onclick="dC('parityshift')">Parity Shift</span>
    has also been modified in the September 2019 <em>errata</em>.
    The amount of pool is no longer equal to the number of Methusalah, but is stable at 3.
    The card is then less powerful in the game beginning, but is still a good fit in this deck.
