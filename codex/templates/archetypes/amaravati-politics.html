    <h2>Highlights</h2>
    <p>
        This is a <em>breed & boon</em> political deck using
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('amaravati')">Amaravati</span> as a star for his ability, then creating
        a swarm of Assamite with <span class="card" onclick="dC('embracethe')">The Embrace</span> and
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('webofknivesrecruit')">Web of Knives Recruit</span>, bloating with
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('consanguineousboon')">Consanguineous Boon</span> and
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('haqimslawleadership')">Haqim's Law: Leadership</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
        The deck has a rather slow build-up but a high bloat that makes him sturdy. Furthermore, it delivers
        consistent pool damage with votes on one hand
        (<span class="card" onclick="dC('recklessagitation')">Reckless Agitation</span> and
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('kineresourcescontested')">Kine Resources Contested</span>)
        and bleed actions on the other hand
        (either naked bleeds or with the <span class="card" onclick="dC('loss')">Loss</span> action).
    </p>
    <p>
        The deck has a strong stealth as <i>O</i> is one of his core disciplines.
    </p>
    <h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
    <p>
        During the first half of the game, the deck should focus on breeding and bloating, surviving its predator.
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('heartofnizchetus')">Heart of Nizchetus</span> must come in play as
        early as possible, in order to cycle the aggressive actions foe the time being, and
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('informationhighway')">Information Highway</span> can speed up this first phase.
    </p>
    <p>
        Once a dozen Assamite are out, aggressive votes are used to destroy the prey's pool.
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('sargonfragmentthe')">The Sargon Fragment</span> can be used to fetch
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('recklessagitation')">Reckless Agitation</span> or
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('loss')">Loss</span> back from the ash heap.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('amaravati')">Amaravati</span> should be well protected, using
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('yorubashrine')">Yoruba Shrine</span> and
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('directintervention')">Direct Intervention</span> or sacrificing neonates
        to counter rush actions.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('alamut')">Alamut</span> should be resplenished as much as possible.
        Vampires with <i>o</i> are supposed to get some bleed through (even for 1 pool) to get tokens on it fast.
    </p>
    <h2>Variants</h2>
    <p>
        Regarding the decklist example, some other cards can been included:
        <li>
            <span class="card" onclick="dC('uncoilingthe')">The Uncoiling</span> to defend against
            <span class="card" onclick="dC('scourgeoftheenochians')">Scourge of the Enochians</span>, a common
            counter against breed decks like this one.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="card" onclick="dC('khabarcommunitythe')">The Khabar: Community</span> to help get the
            neonates bleed through.
        </li>
        <li>
            <span class="card" onclick="dC('perfectionist')">Perfectionist</span> and/or
            <span class="card" onclick="dC('coventhe')">The Coven</span> to help get some blood back on
            <span class="card" onclick="dC('amaravati')">Amaravati</span>.
        </li>
        <li>
            Some <span class="card" onclick="dC('deflection')">Deflection</span> and
            <span class="card" onclick="dC('blacksunrise')">Black Sunrise</span> to bump up the defence a bit.
        </li>
    </p>
    <p>
        There is a <strong>Laibon</strong> variant to this deck, using more copies of
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('olugbenga')">Olugbenga</span> and
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('kamaujafari')">Kamau Jafari</span>, then replacing
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('embracethe')">The Embrace</span> by the cheaper
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('bamba')">Bamba</span>.
        This also allows the use of some good Laibon cards like
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('kduvasmask')">Kduva's Mask</span> and
        <span class="card" onclick="dC('secretmustbekeptthe')">The Secret Must Be Kept</span>.
        <a href="{{ url_for('deck_search.index', twda_id='2011italyqtgenova') }}">Riccardo Fabiani's deck</a>
        at the 2011 Italian Grand Prix is a good example.
