## Changelog for Tuesday, May 19th

First tries for L10n and i18n. Was a bit hard and I still can't figure how to get user preference (or it is because my browser do not request for `fr`pages ?)

## A new organization

For better implementation, I reworked the structure of the app to become a modular approach

```
run.py
codex/
	__init__.py
	config.py #
	babel.cfg #
	archetypes/
		__init__.py
		controllers.py
		template/
			...
	strategy/
		__init__.py
		controllers.py
		template/
			...
	static/
		...
	template/
		layout.html
		...
```

This way, each part of the website is treated as a module and I think it will help with future translations

## A bit on L10n and i18n

I followed [this article](https://damyanon.net/post/flask-series-internationalization/) to start using Flask-Babel

I am able to retain the langage preference once it get selected using `url_for` and this code
```python
@app.url_defaults
def add_language_code(endpoint, values):
    if 'lang_code' in values or not g.lang_code:
        return
    if app.url_map.is_endpoint_expecting(endpoint, 'lang_code'):
        values['lang_code'] = g.lang_code
```

But I can't get the user preference without typing it as it seems that nowhere in the previous article this functionality was mentioned

## A bit of translation

I tried myself to get some translation done to see how the whole code was handling it.

**Edit** Thu, May 21 was a French holiday so I used it to translate the root index and the strategy index
